		h3.text-center OUR HISTORY
		p We formed this company in 2010, with a combined engineering experience of over 20 years. From day one we knew we needed to stand out from the crowd, so we always had a strict ‘No Fix/No Fee policy, and always gave a warranty on our work. We always felt that we should always keep things simple and worry free for the customer, and remove the apprehension people can feel when dealing with an electronics repair centre. The team of engineers we have here allow us to do all of this, our management team and shop staff have always been able to work, and act, with absolute confidence in their work. The decisions we made early on to always care for the customer we serve, mean that we have grown a large, loyal customer base.
		p Going forward, we are continuing to focus on the development and growth of our company. As the last couple of years have shown us, there is no limit to the number of services that we can provide.
